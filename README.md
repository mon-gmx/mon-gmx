# Hello world!

Hey there! you found my github account. While this is not a very active place, I still post repositories and snippets from time to time. In another time I used to contribute to projects using the monchitos82 account (closed). Feel like having a chat? you can open an issue in this repository, I know that is not very conventional, but it is the way I want it.

## About me

I have been a computer systems engineer for the past two decades. I have some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large number (I can also play with raspberries), write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to meet people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring, but I am more of a jack of all trades so I end up learning more from others.

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries and continued that streak with my professional life.

I may come back here from time to time and speak of things I have in my mind. I don't contribute to any other social media platforms, I like to be the only loon in my feed, so yeah that's it.

## Simple

In the gist of many things going on lately around my own life I come close in contact with a lot of complaints about how things keep degrading in quality and surging in price and I keep reaching over and over again to the same conclusion: simple was, is and will always be better. Focusing on shells full of gimmicks tends to always give us the same outcome yet we often just don't get it. I usually am triggered by buzzwords like _slice and dice_ or _democratize_ but I come to really sympathize with this one: _enshitification_.

I like my code with zero boilerplate, my internet with zero limits, my services with zero subscriptions and the list goes on. I am not against progress, progress is good, that's why cars are safer and phones are faster, yet this decade all we get are flashy pinatas solving no problem, but the problem created to keep the greedy appeased. I never realized how much I miss what is simple and reliable. Screw those flashy trims and non-sense all glued together gadgets, let's go back to simple, there's where beauty of crafting lies, that's where we have control.

## The challenges of finding alternatives (and purpose)

I have to start this entry by admitting how hard it is for me to write it. Like with many other things, I am rusty on writing. But I love the challenge of doing so. This along with other activities I enjoy doing likely don't produce me other sources of income yet I like to think they foster the skills to actually find those other sources.
Being in a limited immigration status is a constraint that forces one to think how to do other things that in a better situation would actually unlock one from doing more things than having a job. I like my branch, don't get me wrong, I might not be the sharpest doing what I do, but I can defend myself well and get acquainted with skills needed to solve problems, in any case, we can get as creative as a task requires and our human urge for purpose can be overwhelming. What am I trying to say here?
Well, I'm just thinking out loud on ideas I'd like to explore if the opportunity arises:
1. Explore retaking some retail endeavors, not that I like retail, but I like preparing the project of setting up a store, after all, some of my programming skills were polished writing my own point of sale service.
2. Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle. I love working out, I hate going to a crowded gym. Had I had the opportunity to train people, I'd take it. I am in no position to brag (the less owning a formal education), but to acknowledge I have more years in weightlifting than I do as an engineer: 24 to be precise.
3. Produce media. Even writing more than my markdown.
4. Put time into becoming sustainable. This sounds odd when I talk about producing more sources, but I dare to think those additional sources are better honed when one has the discipline to reduce waste. And to my goals, being sustainable is all about discipline. Not to say I'd eat better food and depend less on looneys and their incompetence managing the resources I use.
5. Finally, mentor. I don't dream about teaching; I don't dream about consulting either. I just think that mentoring would be a resource helping me get different ways of approaching a problem while offering my own way to do it so in the end it would be terribly didactic.

I wonder what a GPT tool would suggest about these entries, but let's not wonder, here's an extract of my conversation:

> It's great to see that you have clear goals in mind and are looking for ways to achieve them despite any constraints you may have. Here are some suggestions for activities that can help you work towards each of your goals:
> 
> Explore retail endeavors:
> 
> Start by researching different retail opportunities that interest you, such as online stores, pop-up shops, or niche markets.
> Use your programming skills to develop a point-of-sale system tailored to your needs or explore existing solutions that align with your vision.
> Create a business plan outlining your goals, target audience, budget, and marketing strategies.
> Consider starting small by testing your ideas at local markets or through online platforms before committing to a full-scale retail operation.
> Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle:
> 
> Design a home workout routine using your home equipment, incorporating your 24 years of weightlifting experience.
> Explore alternative fitness options such as calisthenics, yoga, or outdoor activities like hiking or cycling.
> Set specific fitness goals for yourself, such as increasing strength, improving endurance, or achieving specific lifts or movements.
> Consider becoming certified as a personal trainer or fitness coach to formalize your knowledge and potentially offer training services to others.
> Produce media:
> 
> Start a blog or YouTube channel where you can share your knowledge and experiences in programming, fitness, sustainability, and mentoring.
> Write regularly, whether it's articles, blog posts, or creative writing in Markdown or other formats.
> Experiment with different types of media production, such as podcasts, videos, infographics, or social media content.
> Collaborate with others in your field to create content and reach a wider audience.
> Become sustainable:
> 
> Educate yourself about sustainable living practices, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and choosing eco-friendly products.
> Implement small changes in your daily life, such as reducing plastic usage, composting, or shopping locally and seasonally.
> Set goals for yourself related to sustainability, such as reducing your carbon footprint or supporting environmentally conscious businesses.
> Share your journey towards sustainability with others to inspire and educate them about the importance of environmental stewardship.
> Mentor others:
> 
> Seek out opportunities to mentor individuals who are interested in programming, fitness, entrepreneurship, or sustainability.
> Offer your expertise and guidance through online communities, forums, or mentorship programs.
> Volunteer your time with local organizations or schools to mentor students or aspiring professionals in your areas of expertise.
> Stay open to learning from your mentees as well, as mentoring is a two-way street that can benefit both parties.
> Remember to prioritize your goals and allocate time and resources accordingly. It's okay to start small and gradually work towards bigger objectives. Stay focused, stay adaptable, and keep pushing yourself to grow and develop in all areas of your life.

I won't deny, these answers are a bit generic, but seem well intentioned. Maybe I should add point 6 to improve my prompting skills to extract better recommendations. Maybe point 7 would be: be an activist of regulating AI and intellectual property? My master's thesis (with a flawed English) focused on the challenges IP had in my country due to piracy... seems about right to take another dive into the topic.

## Back and almost sad

So, over a couple of weeks, while traveling home, I could see something; I cannot call it either nerve-wrecking or heartbreaking, it is just an upsetting sight. I went back and came to see that things have not changed much. I love change, it is annoyingly painful, it is uncomfortable, it is full of unknowns, but it is necessary. I see my country policing is trying to hold on to old ideas while the population is trying to move on. I saw that throwing money without planning to the aches we have as society is doing more harm than good. Now, I come back with a sense of gratefulness on what it means to have opportunities and I wish my land had a few things back in their list of priorities: tolerance, opportunity, education, respect and a sense of criticism. I hope at some point, my fellow nationals exchange handouts for any of these.

Anyways, I am back, I am thankful for the clean air and for seeing another week, one which I am quite eager for it to start.

## A few cues on how to build right

This is not a very thorough guide on how to do things right, but a retrospective on everything that can go wrong when things aren't done... right, right.

13 years ago I got a house. That house was built to last. It is solid. But it has not aged well. This kind of reminds me of how we build things (call it products, software, services...) and how often we forget some basics on what constitutes something that is well built.

I wanted to use some "features" of my house as analogies on how things are not built properly, but I can only think of examples and will let you fill in the blanks; here are some of its perks:

- The stairs turn 3 times and are surrounded by an iron handrail. It looks nice, except when you bring furniture larger than the first 5 steps, then you wish levitating was something we could do
- The windows are an iron grid with plenty of panels of glass, their size is not standard. The inner side slides to the sides, but they are in a second and third story building. They can't be cleaned. They have no weather strips, they are heavy so they don't open
- The closet doors slide with no rail guides. So they often misalign
- Any shelves and cabinets are embedded in the walls. They cannot be unmounted and the walls are brick and mortar
- The top level is a terrace. With no tilt. So rain floods the stairs
- Rising dampness is no strange, but fixing it is not easy when there are no plans on the water lines
- There are few power outlets, adding more is not a cut here, wire there kind of thing. Brick and mortar
- The kitchen has no room for the appliances
- Every bathroom is different, shape, color, size, you name it

This sounds like a tough case of building as you need (or better said as you earn), yet the house is nice when things work. And this kind of reminds me of how things are built nowadays. They work fine as long as nothing external changes. It is also a nice reminder on things to keep in mind whenever we build things:

- Make it simple (simple means easy to use, easy to live with and as byproduct, it will age well)
- Make it easy to maintain (make sure you can clean the windows and change the lights)
- Make it easy to fix (even if you can change a light, make sure you can replace a cable when the time comes)
- Make it using standards and follow them
- Make it solid
- Make it easy to scale

I wish I had some solar panels installed in it... something tells me they would end up being installed in the garage. :laughing:

## Back again

I wish I had something interesting to write about yet in preparation for doing better things with my time I just have my head somewhere else. Still I find the will to do some notes on things I'd like to see in my workplace anytime soon, since they are betting for having rails/shorts/vines... rather than leveraging their own base, here are my two cents:

The tone at the platform is hideous at best. It is all about showing off how cringey you can be about working or not working while still thinking about work. The tone is simply insane. So instead of giving it a push and driving us sane people further from it, why not push where your site shines? Getting a job and getting connected?

I'd love to see you interview on the same page you apply for a position. Not leaving the platform has many benefits both for the hiring folk and for the applicant. Having insights on your recent achievements in your learning path is also useful to drive a conversation, show them to the interviewer, but for real, having the interviewing, notepad, doc management and whatever it takes to get talent is something that is not far from reach but somehow the platform insists on being Meta.

Did you attend a course? have conversation starters with people with the same interests. Don't add the AI collab bs, invite people to share their work and share ideas, you have comments but no Q&A ranking and the existing Q&A is just a feed of comments, sites like StackOverflow would be easily replaced by sections where answering questions and ranking answers without the anonymity invites people to be less toxic, or at least some of them, which basically is what makes StackOverflow suck.

I think making the platform a place for sharing ideas on topics they care about (not where you infer they are experts) and giving them the whole package for landing a job rather than just getting the first step done is far more important than having short videos. But well, this is the world we live in and catching up with the rest is the name of the game for now.

## Going home

After 5 long years (that felt like 10), I am going home. I came to the US with close to no idea on how life would be and as challenging it has been, it has been the opportunity of a lifetime. I regret not having done more of this time, cannot admit I was complacent, however the opportunities and the migratory situation hardly aligned so I did as much as my situation, intellect and skill allowed me, and it was as people likes to say: a net positive. I made a bunch of mistakes, I became more dedicated, unfortunately I made no close friends but I got many new acquaintances, I went through a lot and I learned a vast amount of things, a new working culture (Silicon Valley one), a different community, a whole different set of rules, a whole different way of doing things, I became more critical on many subjects, I kind of fell in love with what America can offer (not to say its astonishing national parks) I truly enjoyed contributing to the American economy and learning what opportunity can actually bring in people's life. It was eye opening from the first day. I am deeply grateful to my employer and of course, to the land of the free.

My mind is filled with gratitude and a bit of anxiety on what's to come... but I am going home. :house:

## Why doing something matters

Once you reach a certain age you come to question everything you know and everything you believe in. Most of us did that when we were teenagers. But it happens again and unlike back when we were young, you do it with a different perspective. If you have been lucky enough to live through different ups and downs, the point of reference widens and the criticism on what's right, what's wrong and what can be changed kind of extends. It is a fascinating state of mind as a spectator, yet it is always good to have some retrospective and apply the same to ourselves. Then we question our purpose. I think when we do that, we understand the relevance of being busy, the relevance of feeling useful and even the relevance of getting things done no matter how nice or hideous they are to us, if we are fortunate enough to be able to choose to be occupied, that's a blessing overall, because the mind rarely settles.

Having purpose often conflicts with our perception on what a successful life is though. We often warp our perception of what we have achieved based on the recognition others provide. While this is a good measurement when others mean the society we contribute to, it is hard to use as the only metric. Not everyone gets to make a trillion dollar business, not everyone leads a country and for sure not everyone creates a relativity theory. Where is that putting us as individuals and how can we figure out if we are living a meaningful life? Before I fall further into the philosophical rabbithole, I just want to subtract the entry to something less stingy: why we need to do things in the first place.

Many of us are born with talent. That is the big differentiator between being good at something and being great. Yet talent is like color in a gemstone. A white gemstone will be less attractive than a red one, but it is only until the white one is cut, and polished that it overcomes the lack of color and it becomes sought after. Yes, the same or even more can be achieved with the red one, but it is the work that's put into them that gives them the additional value. Doing things is shaping, is inspiring and it is the only way to fail often enough that we can actually claim expertise.

Is this suggesting doing anything is useful? Well, I think, it really depends on what use we want of it. Oftentimes we just want to grind for the sake of breaking away and feel like we achieved something. Other times, we are preparing for a greater task and end up finding that the preparation was the greater task itself. So what am I trying to say anyway? That even when a task sucks you should do it, that you should always be busy, that doing things is the best time to learn and that it is only when you do things that you find real joy, because it is only when you are doing things that you find purpose and maybe for us with our finite amount of time, is the shortest path to find success.

## Ragrets

Now that I go into a new life event I wanted to make a list of regrets that I have. I could deceivingly say I have none, but then I would have no lessons to take away with me, so at least regrets are reflections on decisions I could have made differently. So without further ado, I can start:

1. Not going straight into my perm process is probably the first one. I moved to a different country without a good idea on what to expect, but a challenge. I came in as a temporary worker and got sold into the temporary word quite fast. Had I weighed in all it takes to move and start again, probably one of the first things I would get rid of is the temporary label.
2. Not engaging earlier. I think 2010 was a great time to be in the USA by many measures. I was sold into the idea of trying my luck in Europe. I think I had far better and stronger career opportunities, I just happened to stumble upon those almost ten years later. I think at the very least my net worth would be far different by now.
3. Not investing continuously in my education. Now that I take a break from my work activities, one of the first things I have committed to is my education. I deeply regret not visiting the public library once a week as I do now. Yes, I used to go through learning courses and safari books (I can proudly say I got a top learner badge at least twice), but I think the value of books is irreplaceable and well probably I'd be 200 books further in my reading habits by now.
4. Not getting involved in a community. Visibility is paramount for a healthy career. Unfortunately doing the weight lifting under the cover of business can result in frustration when we see we don't move forward as fast as people doing less grunt work but greater PR stunts. Being in Silicon Valley was the opportunity of a lifetime, yet staying locked, solving problems where my contribution was constrained to the tasks I was paid for was not the wisest option, especially before COVID took place.
5. Not moving early enough. As absurd as it may sound, a long tenure in this place is not a good sign of a healthy career. Even when I still believe I came to work for one of the best if not the best working culture in the valley, but missed many others. Yes, FAANG can mean many things: an easy entry to other jobs, a way to get a great salary, a golden ticket in a resume, but above all of that, it means working with brilliant people and sticking to one place of course has the trade off of missing the opportunity to learn from other great minds.
6. Going into survival mode. We have often heard about how difficult situations bring great opportunities. I got to experience this in person when COVID hit. I think most of the greatest opportunities happened as we panicked and went into a lock down. I think among the best opportunities I passed on due to the struggle of either taking risks or trying to get out of it alive I missed the opportunity to pursue a promotion with little friction. I missed the opportunity to move to an affordable city where my cost of life would greatly decrease. I missed the opportunity to experience working in a Nordic country. Yes, I got the jab. Yes, I met dire circumstances (loss of loved ones). But looking back, the big loss I see is getting more invested in trading meme stocks rather than investing in placing myself where opportunity was.
My list could grow larger, but overall, as I write these lines I come to a simple conclusion: my regrets are all around not being available to opportunities. I think writing is a great way to understand our life decisions so even when this is admitting flaws in my judgment during multiple situations, I have zero regrets about writing this entry.

<hr/>

## Small bursts.

This is a section I plan on dedicating to small bursts of comments. I often like to add my opinion and illustrate it with the help of copilot, while I enjoy doing that, it is time consuming and I want to be thoughtful about what I write, yet I need to drop some thoughts from time to time and probably here is the right place, so a section is born (?), I am still not interested in making this a github.io page the less moving to a content provider (and of course not getting a domain, that's pricey when done right).


### DevOps is not SRE, or is it?

This is a silly shitpost, but I want to share it because it is often used as a synonym and great people end up hating their duties due to the huge confusion Google created with this term. So wanna know the difference? I think I can summarize it in a few lines: SRE means engineers **obsessed** about site up, performance, service levels and whatever it takes to get there. Fix code? Yes, Fix infra? Yes, Fix monitoring? Of course!, Negotiate service levels? Maybe, Automation? Yes! DevOps on the other hand is handling the power to run a service to its developers, no more sysadmin doing your dirty work. So essentially, it looks like DevOps should be doing SRE, right? I tend to see it the other way around, SRE will do the DevOps part to keep the lights on. DevOps (although it should not) focuses on the tools to make the show run smoothly from inception to deployment. So in real life what does it mean? Want the best, most bad ass container maniacs that can do CI/CD? get yourself a DevOps guy. Want to get your service fine tuned and focus on building at scale? Get yourself an SRE.

### Desperation is fuel.

I try to steer away from discussing political issues when going online. There is no way to win and the outcome is never useful to create new ties. So I will only point out some traits that bring me to the thoughts that defined the title. During my lifetime I have been able to live in different countries; some were more tied to what we used to call the east and some that represent the west itself. I noticed that many of our systems, intentionally or not, are good enablers for people to make bad decisions that will result in desperation for them. Bad decisions paired with a poor education are catastrophic, despite this, it is easier to get in trouble than it is to get out of it, or better yet, not to get into it in the first place.
I bite my tongue to provide specific examples that can be interpreted as criticism of a specific nation (it has never been my intention), but I think these few I will provide will resonate to many. You have access to egregious types of debt that limit the ability to make good decisions for yourself. You are at a constant risk of losing wealth, health or both with no easy recovery in sight. You are often pushed to pursue a poor quality of life in exchange for limited opportunity. Why am I writing these lines anyway? I am just reflecting on how easy it is to build desperation rather than prosperity in our current frameworks and how frightening this is knowing there is not much commitment to do things differently as we mostly (and reasonably nonetheless) run in this wild rat race that we call life.

### A month has gone by

Just like the title says, tomorrow marks the first month since I came back to my land. It has been super exhaustive. I had no idea on how many things we had to sort out, to fix, to get done and still we find everyday there's something else missing. Simply put, I've never been busier. I am happy to be back, I am happy to be busy and I hope for having yet more things to do in the near future because being busy is fuel for me. Along the things I had to sort out (including fixing many home owner shenanigans, I had the opportunity to put back to use my raspberry pi's cluster which has been didactic as usual; now I am in the search for projects that can put to good use the 80% CPU I have left for those few machines.

### Missing America

America is a difficult place. It is a country that is build to test you, the place where you can be the best version of yourself and the place where you can meet your worst fate. Yet I think America is unique and I miss a lot from it. I don't miss its savage health system or its weirdness regarding races and mindsets. I miss what freedom means there, I miss its people and I miss what its people made of it. I don't feel sorry or regretful about leaving America, after all, my home is not there. I think America is a great example of what a country can be except it is hard to understand it unless you've been there for longer than a vacation. The love of the land, the make it work no matter what, the do it right and do it best mindsets are what I miss the hardest. I wish my country had some vague resemblance to those ideas, but hey, not everywhere is the same.
