# hello world!

Hey there! you found my github account. While this is not a very active place, I still post repositories and snippets from time to time. In another time I used to contribute to projects using the monchitos82 account (closed). Feel like having a chat? you can open an issue in the **[talk-to-me](https://github.com/mon88-mx/talk-to-me/issues)** repository, I know that is not very conventional, but it is something.

## About me

I am a computer systems engineer since the last two decades. I have some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large number (I can also play with raspberries), write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to know people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring people, but I am more of a jack of all trades so I end up learning more from others.

:computer:

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries and continued that streak with my professional life.

I may come back here from time to time and speak of things I have in my mind. I don't contribute to any other social media platform, I like to be the only loon in my feed, so yeah that's it.

## Simple

In the gist of many things going on lately around my own life I come close in contact with a lot of complains about how things keep degrading in quality and surging in price and I keep reaching over and over again to the same conclusion: simple was, is and will always be better. Focusing on shells full of gimmicks tend to always give us the same outcome yet we often just don't get it. I usually am triggered by buzzwords like _slice and dice_ or _democratize_ but I come to really sympathize with this one: _enshitification_.

I used to like my interpreters stupid simple, my code with zero boilerplate, my internet with zero limits, my services with zero subscriptions and the list goes on. I am not against progress, progress is good, that's why cars are safer and phones are faster, yet this decade all we get are flashy pinatas. I never realized how much I missed my stupid ugly steel wheels until I got some glossy 21" that caused me gastritis the second I scratched them. Screw those flashing lights, let's go back to simple, there's where beauty of crafting lies, that's where we have control.
