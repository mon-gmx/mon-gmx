# hello world!

Hey there! you found my github account. While this is not a very active place, I still post repositories and snippets from time to time. In another time I used to contribute to projects using the monchitos82 account (closed). Feel like having a chat? you can open an issue in the **[talk-to-me](https://github.com/mon88-mx/talk-to-me/issues)** repository, I know that is not very conventional, but it is the way I want it.

## About me

I am a computer systems engineer since the past two decades. I have some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large number (I can also play with raspberries), write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to know people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring people, but I am more of a jack of all trades so I end up learning more from others.

:computer:

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries and continued that streak with my professional life.

I may come back here from time to time and speak of things I have in my mind. I don't contribute to any other social media platforms, I like to be the only loon in my feed, so yeah that's it.

## Simple

In the gist of many things going on lately around my own life I come close in contact with a lot of complains about how things keep degrading in quality and surging in price and I keep reaching over and over again to the same conclusion: simple was, is and will always be better. Focusing on shells full of gimmicks tend to always give us the same outcome yet we often just don't get it. I usually am triggered by buzzwords like _slice and dice_ or _democratize_ but I come to really sympathize with this one: _enshitification_.

I like my code with zero boilerplate, my internet with zero limits, my services with zero subscriptions and the list goes on. I am not against progress, progress is good, that's why cars are safer and phones are faster, yet this decade all we get are flashy pinatas solving no problem, but the problem created to keep the greedy appeased. I never realized how much I miss simple and reliable. Screw those flashy trims and non-sense all glued together gadgets, let's go back to simple, there's where beauty of crafting lies, that's where we have control.

## The challenges of finding alternatives (and purpose)

I have to start this entry by admiting how hard it is for me to write it. Like with many other things, I am rusty on writing. But I love the challenge of doing so. This along other activities I enjoy doing likely don't produce me other sources of income yet I like to think they foster the skills to actually find those other sources.
Being in a limited immigration status is a constraint that forces one to think how to do other things that in a better situation would actually unlock one from doing more things than having a job. I like my branch, don't get me wrong, I might not be the sharpest doing what I do, but I can well defend myself and get acquainted with skills needed to solve problems, in any case, we can get as creative as a task requires and our human urge for purpose can be overwhelming. What am I trying to say here?
Well, I'm just thinking out loud on ideas I'd like to explore if the opportunity arises:
1. Explore retaking some retail endeavors, not that I like retail, but I like preparing the project of setting up a store, after all, some of my programming skills were polished writing my own point of sale service.
2. Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle. I love working out, I hate going to a crowded gym. Had I had the opportunity to train people, I'd take it. I am in no position to brag (the less owning a formal education), but to acknowledge I have more years in weightlifting than I do as an engineer: 24 to be precise.
3. Produce media. Even writing more than my markdown.
4. Put time into becoming sustainable. This sounds odd when I talk about producing more sources, but I dare to think those additional sources are better honed when one has the discipline to reduce waste. And to my goals, being sustainable is all about discipline. Not to say I'd eat better food and depend less on looneys and their incompetence managing the resources I use.
5. Finally, mentor. I don't dream about teaching; I don't dream about consulting either. I just think that mentoring would be a resource helping me get different ways of approaching a problem while offering my own way to do it so in the end it would be terribly didactic.

I wonder what a GPT tool would suggest about these entries, but let's not wonder, here's an extract of my conversation:

> It's great to see that you have clear goals in mind and are looking for ways to achieve them despite any constraints you may have. Here are some suggestions for activities that can help you work towards each of your goals:
> 
> Explore retail endeavors:
> 
> Start by researching different retail opportunities that interest you, such as online stores, pop-up shops, or niche markets.
> Use your programming skills to develop a point-of-sale system tailored to your needs or explore existing solutions that align with your vision.
> Create a business plan outlining your goals, target audience, budget, and marketing strategies.
> Consider starting small by testing your ideas at local markets or through online platforms before committing to a full-scale retail operation.
> Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle:
> 
> Design a home workout routine using your kettlebell and resistance bands, incorporating your 24 years of weightlifting experience.
> Explore alternative fitness options such as calisthenics, yoga, or outdoor activities like hiking or cycling.
> Set specific fitness goals for yourself, such as increasing strength, improving endurance, or achieving specific lifts or movements.
> Consider becoming certified as a personal trainer or fitness coach to formalize your knowledge and potentially offer training services to others.
> Produce media:
> 
> Start a blog or YouTube channel where you can share your knowledge and experiences in programming, fitness, sustainability, and mentoring.
> Write regularly, whether it's articles, blog posts, or creative writing in Markdown or other formats.
> Experiment with different types of media production, such as podcasts, videos, infographics, or social media content.
> Collaborate with others in your field to create content and reach a wider audience.
> Become sustainable:
> 
> Educate yourself about sustainable living practices, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and choosing eco-friendly products.
> Implement small changes in your daily life, such as reducing plastic usage, composting, or shopping locally and seasonally.
> Set goals for yourself related to sustainability, such as reducing your carbon footprint or supporting environmentally conscious businesses.
> Share your journey towards sustainability with others to inspire and educate them about the importance of environmental stewardship.
> Mentor others:
> 
> Seek out opportunities to mentor individuals who are interested in programming, fitness, entrepreneurship, or sustainability.
> Offer your expertise and guidance through online communities, forums, or mentorship programs.
> Volunteer your time with local organizations or schools to mentor students or aspiring professionals in your areas of expertise.
> Stay open to learning from your mentees as well, as mentoring is a two-way street that can benefit both parties.
> Remember to prioritize your goals and allocate time and resources accordingly. It's okay to start small and gradually work towards bigger objectives. Stay focused, stay adaptable, and keep pushing yourself to grow and develop in all areas of your life.

I won't deny, these answers are bit generic, but seem well intentioned. Maybe I should add as point 6 improve my prompting skills to extract better recommendations. Maybe point 7 would be: be an activist of regulating AI and intellectual property? My master's thesis (while flawed in English) focused on the challenges IP had in my country against piracy... seems about right to take another dive into the topic.

## Back and almost sad

So, over a couple of weeks, while traveling home, I could see something; cannot call it either nerve-wrecking or heartbreaking, it is just an upsetting sight. I went back and came to see that things have not changed much. I love change, it is annoyingly painful, it is uncomfortable, it is full of unknowns, but it is necessary. I see my country policing is trying to hold on to old ideas while the population is trying to move on. I saw that throwing money without planning to the aches we have as society is doing more harm than good. Now, I come back with a sense of gratefulness on what it means to have opportunities and I wish my land had a few things back in their list of priorities: tolerance, opportunity, education, respect and a sense of criticism. I hope at some point, my fellow nationals exchange handouts for any of these.

Anyways, I am back, I am thankful for the clean air and for seeing another week, one which I am quite eager for it to start.
