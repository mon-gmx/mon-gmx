# hello world!

Hey there! you found my github account. While this is not a very active place, I still post repositories and snippets from time to time. In another time I used to contribute to projects using the monchitos82 account (closed). Feel like having a chat? you can open an issue in the **[talk-to-me](https://github.com/mon88-mx/talk-to-me/issues)** repository, I know that is not very conventional, but it is something.

## About me

I am a computer systems engineer since the last two decades. I have some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large number (I can also play with raspberries), write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to know people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring people, but I am more of a jack of all trades so I end up learning more from others.

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries (ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª) and continued that streak with my professional life (ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).

I may come back here from time to time and speak of things I have in my mind. I don't contribute to any other social media platform, I like to be the only loon in my feed, so yeah that's it.
