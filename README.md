Hey there! you found my github account. While this is not a very active place, I still post repositories and snippets from time to time. In another time I used to contribute to projects using the monchitos82 account (closed). 

## About me (02/24)

I have been a computer systems engineer for the past two decades. I have some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large number (I can also play with raspberries), write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to meet people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring, but I am more of a jack of all trades so I end up learning more from others.

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries and continued that streak with my professional life.

I may come back here from time to time and speak of things I have in my mind. I don't contribute to any other social media platforms, I like to be the only loon in my feed, so yeah that's it.

## Simplicity is king in my world (02/24)

In the gist of many things going on lately around my own life I come close in contact with a lot of complaints about how things keep degrading in quality and surging in price and I keep reaching over and over again to the same conclusion: simple was, is and will always be better. Focusing on shells full of gimmicks tends to always give us the same outcome yet we often just don't get it. I usually am triggered by buzzwords like _slice and dice_ or _democratize_ but I come to really sympathize with this one: _enshitification_.

I like my code with zero boilerplate, my internet with zero limits, my services with zero subscriptions and the list goes on. I am not against progress, progress is good, that's why cars are safer and phones are faster, yet this decade all we get are flashy pinatas solving no problem, but the problem created to keep the greedy appeased. I never realized how much I miss what is simple and reliable. Screw those flashy trims and non-sense all glued together gadgets, let's go back to simple, there's where beauty of crafting lies, that's where we have control.

## The challenges of finding alternatives... and purpose (02/24)

I have to start this entry by admitting how hard it is for me to write it. Like with many other things, I am rusty on writing. But I love the challenge of doing so. This along with other activities I enjoy doing likely don't produce me other sources of income yet I like to think they foster the skills to actually find those other sources.
Being in a limited immigration status is a constraint that forces one to think how to do other things that in a better situation would actually unlock one from doing more things than having a job. I like my branch, don't get me wrong, I might not be the sharpest doing what I do, but I can defend myself well and get acquainted with skills needed to solve problems, in any case, we can get as creative as a task requires and our human urge for purpose can be overwhelming. What am I trying to say here?
Well, I'm just thinking out loud on ideas I'd like to explore if the opportunity arises:
1. Explore retaking some retail endeavors, not that I like retail, but I like preparing the project of setting up a store, after all, some of my programming skills were polished writing my own point of sale service.
2. Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle. I love working out, I hate going to a crowded gym. Had I had the opportunity to train people, I'd take it. I am in no position to brag (the less owning a formal education), but to acknowledge I have more years in weightlifting than I do as an engineer: 24 to be precise.
3. Produce media. Even writing more than my markdown.
4. Put time into becoming sustainable. This sounds odd when I talk about producing more resources, but I dare to think those additional resources are better honed when one has the discipline to reduce waste. And to my goals, being sustainable is all about discipline. Not to say I'd eat better food and depend less on looneys and their incompetence managing the resources I use.
5. Finally, mentor. I don't dream about teaching; I don't dream about consulting either. I just think that mentoring would be a resource helping me get different ways of approaching a problem while offering my own way to do it so in the end it would be terribly didactic.

I wonder what a GPT tool would suggest about these entries, but let's not wonder, here's an extract of my conversation:

> It's great to see that you have clear goals in mind and are looking for ways to achieve them despite any constraints you may have. Here are some suggestions for activities that can help you work towards each of your goals:
> 
> Explore retail endeavors:
> 
> Start by researching different retail opportunities that interest you, such as online stores, pop-up shops, or niche markets.
> Use your programming skills to develop a point-of-sale system tailored to your needs or explore existing solutions that align with your vision.
> Create a business plan outlining your goals, target audience, budget, and marketing strategies.
> Consider starting small by testing your ideas at local markets or through online platforms before committing to a full-scale retail operation.
> Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle:
> 
> Design a home workout routine using your home equipment, incorporating your 24 years of weightlifting experience.
> Explore alternative fitness options such as calisthenics, yoga, or outdoor activities like hiking or cycling.
> Set specific fitness goals for yourself, such as increasing strength, improving endurance, or achieving specific lifts or movements.
> Consider becoming certified as a personal trainer or fitness coach to formalize your knowledge and potentially offer training services to others.
> Produce media:
> 
> Start a blog or YouTube channel where you can share your knowledge and experiences in programming, fitness, sustainability, and mentoring.
> Write regularly, whether it's articles, blog posts, or creative writing in Markdown or other formats.
> Experiment with different types of media production, such as podcasts, videos, infographics, or social media content.
> Collaborate with others in your field to create content and reach a wider audience.
> Become sustainable:
> 
> Educate yourself about sustainable living practices, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and choosing eco-friendly products.
> Implement small changes in your daily life, such as reducing plastic usage, composting, or shopping locally and seasonally.
> Set goals for yourself related to sustainability, such as reducing your carbon footprint or supporting environmentally conscious businesses.
> Share your journey towards sustainability with others to inspire and educate them about the importance of environmental stewardship.
> Mentor others:
> 
> Seek out opportunities to mentor individuals who are interested in programming, fitness, entrepreneurship, or sustainability.
> Offer your expertise and guidance through online communities, forums, or mentorship programs.
> Volunteer your time with local organizations or schools to mentor students or aspiring professionals in your areas of expertise.
> Stay open to learning from your mentees as well, as mentoring is a two-way street that can benefit both parties.
> Remember to prioritize your goals and allocate time and resources accordingly. It's okay to start small and gradually work towards bigger objectives. Stay focused, stay adaptable, and keep pushing yourself to grow and develop in all areas of your life.

I won't deny, these answers are a bit generic, but seem well intentioned. Maybe I should add point 6 to improve my prompting skills to extract better recommendations. Maybe point 7 would be: be an activist of regulating AI and intellectual property? My master's thesis (with a flawed English) focused on the challenges IP had in my country due to piracy... seems about right to take another dive into the topic.

## Back (02/24)

So, over a couple of weeks, while traveling home, I could see something; I cannot call it either nerve-wrecking or heartbreaking, it is just an upsetting sight. I went back and came to see that things have not changed much. I love change, it is annoyingly painful, it is uncomfortable, it is full of unknowns, but it is necessary. I see my country policing is trying to hold on to old ideas while the population is trying to move on. I saw that throwing money without planning to the aches we have as society is doing more harm than good. Now, I come back with a sense of gratefulness on what it means to have opportunities and I wish my land had a few things back in their list of priorities: tolerance, opportunity, education, respect and a sense of criticism. I hope at some point, my fellow nationals exchange handouts for any of these.

Anyways, I am back, I am thankful for the clean air and for seeing another week, one which I am quite eager for it to start.

## A few cues on how to build right (04/24)

This is not a very thorough guide on how to do things right, but a retrospective on everything that can go wrong when things aren't done... right, right.

13 years ago I got a house. That house was built to last. It is solid. But it has not aged well. This kind of reminds me of how we build things (call it products, software, services...) and how often we forget some basics on what constitutes something that is well built.

I wanted to use some "features" of my house as analogies on how things are not built properly, but I can only think of examples and will let you fill in the blanks; here are some of its perks:

- The stairs turn 3 times and are surrounded by an iron handrail. It looks nice, except when you bring furniture larger than the first 5 steps, then you wish levitating was something we could do
- The windows are an iron grid with plenty of panels of glass, their size is not standard. The inner side slides to the sides, but they are in a second and third story building. They can't be cleaned. They have no weather strips, they are heavy so they don't open
- The closet doors slide with no rail guides. So they often misalign
- Any shelves and cabinets are embedded in the walls. They cannot be unmounted without breaking something else and the walls are brick and mortar
- The top level is a terrace. With no tilt. So rain floods the stairs
- Rising dampness is no strange, but fixing it is not easy when there are no plans on the water lines
- There are few power outlets, adding more is not a cut here, wire there kind of thing. Brick and mortar ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- The kitchen has no room for the appliances, so a nice fridge with double doors unless it is a sticker on the wall it will not fit
- Every bathroom is different, shape, color, size, you name it

This sounds like a tough case of building as you need (or better said as you earn), yet the house is nice when things work. And this kind of reminds me of how things are built nowadays. They work fine as long as nothing external changes. It is also a nice reminder on things to keep in mind whenever we build things:

- Make it simple (simple means easy to use, easy to live with and as byproduct, it will age well)
- Make it easy to maintain (make sure you can clean the windows and change the lights)
- Make it easy to fix (even if you can change a light, make sure you can replace a cable when the time comes)
- Make it using standards and follow them
- Make it solid
- Make it easy to scale

I wish I had some solar panels installed in it... something tells me they would end up being installed in the garage. :laughing:

<hr/>

## Back again (04/24)

I wish I had something interesting to write about yet in preparation for doing better things with my time I just have my head somewhere else. Still I find the will to do some notes on things I'd like to see in my workplace anytime soon, since they are betting for having rails/shorts/vines... rather than leveraging their own base, here are my two cents:

The tone at the platform is hideous at best. It is all about showing off how cringey you can be about working or not working while still thinking about work. The tone is simply insane. So instead of giving it a push and driving us sane people further from it, why not push where your site shines? Getting a job and getting connected?

I'd love to see you interview on the same page you apply for a position. Not leaving the platform has many benefits both for the hiring folk and for the applicant. Having insights on your recent achievements in your learning path is also useful to drive a conversation, show them to the interviewer, but for real, having the interviewing, notepad, doc management and whatever it takes to get talent is something that is not far from reach but somehow the platform insists on being Meta.

Did you attend a course? have conversation starters with people with the same interests. Don't add the AI collab bs, invite people to share their work and share ideas, you have comments but no Q&A ranking and the existing Q&A is just a feed of comments, sites like StackOverflow would be easily replaced by sections where answering questions and ranking answers without the anonymity invites people to be less toxic, or at least some of them, which basically is what makes StackOverflow suck.

I think making the platform a place for sharing ideas on topics they care about (not where you infer they are experts) and giving them the whole package for landing a job rather than just getting the first step done is far more important than having short videos. But well, this is the world we live in and catching up with the rest is the name of the game for now.

## Going home (04/24)

After 5 long years (that felt like 10), I am going home. I came to the US with close to no idea on how life would be and as challenging it has been, it has been the opportunity of a lifetime. I regret not having done more of this time, cannot admit I was complacent, however the opportunities and the migratory situation hardly aligned so I did as much as my situation, intellect and skill allowed me, and it was as people likes to say: a net positive. I made a bunch of mistakes, I became more dedicated, unfortunately I made no close friends but I got many new acquaintances, I went through a lot and I learned a vast amount of things, a new working culture (Silicon Valley one), a different community, a whole different set of rules, a whole different way of doing things, I became more critical on many subjects, I kind of fell in love with what America can offer (not to say its astonishing national parks) I truly enjoyed contributing to the American economy and learning what opportunity can actually bring in people's life. It was eye opening from the first day. I am deeply grateful to my employer and of course, to the land of the free.

My mind is filled with gratitude and a bit of anxiety on what's to come... but I am going home! :house:

## Why doing something matters (06/24)

Once you reach a certain age you come to question everything you know and everything you believe in. Most of us did that when we were teenagers. But it happens again and unlike back when we were young, you do it with a different perspective. If you have been lucky enough to live through different ups and downs, the point of reference widens and the criticism on what's right, what's wrong and what can be changed kind of extends. It is a fascinating state of mind as a spectator, yet it is always good to have some retrospective and apply the same to ourselves. Then we question our purpose. I think when we do that, we understand the relevance of being busy, the relevance of feeling useful and even the relevance of getting things done no matter how nice or hideous they are to us, if we are fortunate enough to be able to choose to be occupied, that's a blessing overall, because the mind rarely settles.

Having purpose often conflicts with our perception on what a successful life is though. We often warp our perception of what we have achieved based on the recognition others provide. While this is a good measurement when others mean the society we contribute to, it is hard to use as the only metric. Not everyone gets to make a trillion dollar business, not everyone leads a country and for sure not everyone creates a relativity theory. Where is that putting us as individuals and how can we figure out if we are living a meaningful life? Before I fall further into the philosophical rabbithole, I just want to subtract the entry to something less stingy: why we need to do things in the first place.

Many of us are born with talent. That is the big differentiator between being good at something and being great. Yet talent is like color in a gemstone. A white gemstone will be less attractive than a red one, but it is only until the white one is cut, and polished that it overcomes the lack of color and it becomes sought after. Yes, the same or even more can be achieved with the red one, but it is the work that's put into them that gives them the additional value. Doing things is shaping, is inspiring and it is the only way to fail often enough that we can actually claim expertise.

Is this suggesting doing anything is useful? Well, I think, it really depends on what use we want of it. Oftentimes we just want to grind for the sake of breaking away and feel like we achieved something. Other times, we are preparing for a greater task and end up finding that the preparation was the greater task itself. So what am I trying to say anyway? That even when a task sucks you should do it, that you should always be busy, that doing things is the best time to learn and that it is only when you do things that you find real joy, because it is only when you are doing things that you find purpose and maybe for us with our finite amount of time, is the shortest path to find success.

## A list of ~re~ragrets (06/24)

Now that I go into a new life event I wanted to make a list of regrets that I have. I could deceivingly say I have none, but then I would have no lessons to take away with me, so at least regrets are reflections on decisions I could have made differently. So without further ado, I can start:

1. Not going straight into my perm process is probably the first one. I moved to a different country without a good idea on what to expect, but a challenge. I came in as a temporary worker and got sold into the temporary word quite fast. Had I weighed in all it takes to move and start again, probably one of the first things I would get rid of is the temporary label.
2. Not engaging earlier. I think 2010 was a great time to be in the USA by many measures. I was sold into the idea of trying my luck in Europe. I think I had far better and stronger career opportunities, I just happened to stumble upon those almost ten years later. I think at the very least my net worth would be far different by now.
3. Not investing continuously in my education. Now that I take a break from my work activities, one of the first things I have committed to is my education. I deeply regret not visiting the public library once a week as I do now. Yes, I used to go through learning courses and safari books (I can proudly say I got a top learner badge at least twice), but I think the value of books is irreplaceable and well probably I'd be 200 books further in my reading habits by now.
4. Not getting involved in a community. Visibility is paramount for a healthy career. Unfortunately doing the weight lifting under the cover of business can result in frustration when we see we don't move forward as fast as people doing less grunt work but greater PR stunts. Being in Silicon Valley was the opportunity of a lifetime, yet staying locked, solving problems where my contribution was constrained to the tasks I was paid for was not the wisest option, especially before COVID took place.
5. Not moving early enough. As absurd as it may sound, a long tenure in this place is not a good sign of a healthy career. Even when I still believe I came to work for one of the best if not the best working culture in the valley, but missed many others. Yes, FAANG can mean many things: an easy entry to other jobs, a way to get a great salary, a golden ticket in a resume, but above all of that, it means working with brilliant people and sticking to one place of course has the trade off of missing the opportunity to learn from other great minds.
6. Going into survival mode. We have often heard about how difficult situations bring great opportunities. I got to experience this in person when COVID hit. I think most of the greatest opportunities happened as we panicked and went into a lock down. I think among the best opportunities I passed on due to the struggle of either taking risks or trying to get out of it alive I missed the opportunity to pursue a promotion with little friction. I missed the opportunity to move to an affordable city where my cost of life would greatly decrease. I missed the opportunity to experience working in a Nordic country. Yes, I got the jab. Yes, I met dire circumstances (loss of loved ones). But looking back, the big loss I see is getting more invested in trading meme stocks rather than investing in placing myself where opportunity was.
My list could grow larger, but overall, as I write these lines I come to a simple conclusion: my regrets are all around not being available to opportunities. I think writing is a great way to understand our life decisions so even when this is admitting flaws in my judgment during multiple situations, I have zero regrets about writing this entry.

## Consuming the weather (07/24)

This is not a technical doc, yet tech is what I do. I don't intend to write a post with a lot of instructions and code. Today after some back and forth got to write a consumer (to be run using airflow) capable of querying the national weather service (no API here in Mexico but a humongous compressed JSON), parsing my location and posting this as CSV for a consumer in my grafana instance (infinity). I can say this is fun to do, not frustrating but it requires some thinking. I feel like coming back to doing stuff, I am dumping all in my poor raspberries (which is why I got them anyway) which I fry from time to time. Anyway, fun times ahead. I'm back at getting busy and I love having no pressure to please, just do, just push it.

## Is my connection the issue? (07/24)

Recently I got this as feedback from an interview: _"Your internet connection seems poor"_. I was concerned about it since I want to work remotely when the chance is there without driving my family crazy by hogging the network. I knew I had 150 symmetric Mbps, so what's wrong then? Well, I had no clue, but I could start by monitoring and a quick search got me this neat python library: [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/wiki), so the nerd in me took the chance to write a prometheus sensor and poll the metric constantly. I wrote a non-prod-ready **[gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mon-gmx/8b70cc44a4bf37c0015db1000fb83abc/raw/24ab84640b7c25dc11d002b9940f59f6a8ce7dae/speed_test_sensors.py)** for that matter that paired to a systemd service:

```
  [Unit]
  Description=speedtest

  [Service]
  Type=simple
  User=speedtest
  WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/speedtest
  ExecStart=/var/lib/speedtest/venv/bin/python /var/lib/speedtest/speed_test_sensors.py
  Restart=on-abort

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

got me monitoring my speed in no time. Now to what matters: it is not my connection the one that sucks, yes, it is slow by today's standards, but never degraded below the 90Mbps in any direction, and that's why data trumps everything and why observability is a must whenever dealing with problems where the root cause is not so evident. Will I dig further here? Hell yes, I have `iperf` measuring different latencies between different antennas (my network is simple: `modem -> router -> repeaters (mesh) -> computers`).

## Solving a heat problem (08/24)

This is a small post that could as well go into the bursts one but I want it here for reasons.

### The problem

My tiny home lab consists of 4 raspberry pi 4B boards. They are awesome, I have managed to get them to run all kinds of things, a development sandbox, a DNS, a Grafana server, a Prometheus server, a Jenkins server, a CUPS server, a Samba server and the list goes on. Utilization brings these tiny boards to produce heat and well, heat is not good when it is too much. Reading through manuals and online articles, I find that the ideal temperature for my boards should oscillate in the 50-60 degrees Celsius (120-140). So far so good, having them connected produces heat but having them lying around gets them enough air to reach those 50 degrees without going haywire except for: 
  a) I have 4 boards and not much space for them.
  b) It gets dusty pretty quick here.
  c) Having them somewhere on the floor will make them a perfect meal for my vacuum.

So as the stubborn person I am, I stacked them. This reduces the surface where dust can accumulate and cause more problems but makes it hard to work with them individually, thus, anything I do with the new pack of heat and bits has to be done as a whole.

### First run

So since I stacked my berries, I had a block of acrylic plates bolted with a hub at the bottom of it, something like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2349d279-2587-4d4a-93f3-213729876fc5)

It was a great first run, except that I needed 10 wires going around. It would not matter much except that traditional ethernet cables are thick and 5 of them (1 needs to go to the router) makes it hard to maneuver. Heat was not great either, it was always around 70C when exposed so something needed to be done. And I did. I got myself a $5.00 USB fan and attached it... so yes, another cable. At first it was OK, except that fans are noisy. Must mention here that stacking them included no fans but it did include heat sinks so at least some passive thermal dissipation took place, just not enough. The outcome of this first run was 45C. Since the noise was annoying I tried to get some balance in this setup and added a script to turn on and off the fan according to the temps; if the heat reaches 70C: fan on, if it cools down below 40: fan off. But will that wear my board faster? No idea, I was not up for figuring it out and noise was still coming back every ~30 minutes so not great.

![Screenshot 2024-07-09 101448](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/430e1cda-b733-4ee3-bb22-d46287415e7c)

### Second run

After I moved, I wanted to get my cluster back online ASAP. Though, I had to get a place first for it to sit. I ended up choosing the TV stand, where modem, consoles and other items would sit. I found a not so secluded cupboard and in it went. Cable management became a nightmare though and the fan was still a problem here. Fast forward I noticed something quite peculiar when doing some latency measurements, the hub was limiting the rates to 100Mbps and the wifi could reach 150, would that mean I should go wireless? Well, I gave it a try! The result was gaining some connection speed (the berries sit next to the router, so signal loss is not a concern here), and maybe a good 3 to 5 degrees below, yet not enough!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a85117-19e0-438b-a6e3-3e1211b2a49c)

### Third run

At some point in here I lost my mind with the fan and decided I could let it just get hot. It was not the best decision ever, yet my boards didn't fry. They reached some toasty 80C so not great, but not the worst either, except, right now it is 20C here, so when we reach 35C (and we will), things will get out of control... something has to be done!

I ended up using the blank space from the hub to put some air gaps between the berries, with less cables and less compacted heat things would get better, right? right?!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c041e17-9866-4aac-8a74-dfb52aa69434)

Well turns out things got slightly better (70C better) and when I brought the fan, these boards dropped to a whopping 35C. But hey, I still had the fan. At this point, my berries block was crammed next to my router in a not so great configuration. I thought of adding a gap between boards but they didn't fit, so nope, this was the best I could achieve... was it though?

Something interesting that I found is that I had a damn outlier here. One of the boards (which I acquired later) had a different SD card model, a slower one, but came to see that that exact one had the benefit of less heat... like 10C less heat. Odd enough, the outlier was slower in its read times, so the tradeoff for less heat was speed! huh? Well, I never noticed something off, but I don't benchmark their performance that often, but yeah, faster cards, more heat (take a note!)

### Fourth run

I decided to retry the gaps and all tricks to get rid of the fan, it was a complicated mission but I had to try it.

My first solution was introducing gaps between boards and moving one board out of the stack. This was not the best strategy because cable management trouble came back, I had to find a way to move that USB (power) cable out of the way and sit the board somewhere else in a small space. Had I put it on top of the router, heat would have gone to the router too, but the result was not so bad, I started seeing a drop to 63C

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7825270-43c9-496f-84bb-e224f5997752)

Still the configuration was kind of shitty

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd125d7d-6101-43f4-83e1-421af3d1807b)

### Fifth run, a.k.a. now

So the air gaps play an important role here, I needed to give those heatsinks some fresh air to do their job, but I noticed placement was important too. Until this point, the berries stack was sitting at a corner of a cupboard where I did drill holes for it to move heat out, but it was a corner nevertheless. I decided to redo the setup and move those boards to the front of the board. Back then, opening the door of this piece of furniture did nothing, but it could change, and it did. Part one of my plan: check!

Part two of my plan was adding air gaps between the boards. Somewhere I mentioned I could not fit all boards with air gaps in between each of them, but I didn't mention an important detail, each acrylic plate had about 2 mm of thickness, so getting rid of some plates surely would help, except, the boards needed the plates to be secured into the stack, they were bolted there after all... but what if I just flip them? 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef86375-13b1-407d-b1c1-72e0d38ae9fe)

I ended up with smaller air gaps but I had them there nevertheless. Positioning also took away an important amount of heat because once I put things back in place I saw things staying close to 60C except that when the door went open, those desired 50C were achieved!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a91ff437-829b-4e09-aadb-297a84590c6d)

In the end I still think the fan is what is needed here, I can achieve those 35C wherever I sit my stack by just having the fan on, but it is nice to see that I can just decide to ditch the noise the fan brings and still find the optimal temperature for my tiny stack of computers to work.

In the end this whole back and forth looks like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/567f0a01-fafe-4010-bf9d-2d2759b76de0)

And well, nothing here would be possible without this important sensor output:

`cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`

Uh well, maybe this was not a small burst after all.

## I think SRE needs to go away, even if it won't (09/24)

I have some years of experience as an SRE, years I have really enjoyed doing whatever I had to do as SRE, yet I think SRE needs to go away. This is kind of harsh coming from someone who believes in SRE as a noble role. It was not long ago where we had a division between development teams and operators. Add sysadmin to the mix and it was a hideous mess. We had a bad mix full of ego, limited understanding, extended expectations and lots of hurdles in the name of site-up. I have to start by saying I've taken all the roles here mentioned, no exceptions and I come to believe that when SRE was conceived, this was meant to fix a bunch of vices derivated from the mix I have just mentioned, however, when the term was coined it came with a big flaw, there were no boundaries set and if they were, they are in a [book](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) that hardly anyone has read from cover to cover, and since then, SRE means whatever the fuck those creating an SRE team have in mind, which often is: grab a handful of sysadmins capable of writing YAML, get them trained on how to use a cloud provider API and build a pipeline with any of the _"off the shelf"_ golden hammer that has a CNCF blessing.


Not long ago I was tasked with getting my organization to go through what someone at LinkedIn called SRE 3.0, which was more or less a rip off from Google's initiative to get rid of SRE. The reason both companies claimed to justify these initiatives was that the approach was not scaling right. And well, I think as a practice, it was never intended to scale, (SRE was more about coming and leveling operational flaws through software, then moving on), but this was good enough to get a C-level folk to buy-in and get the meat grinder going.

I must reckon that our company got SRE responsibilities right (Google coined it so they knew what they were talking about, we at LinkedIn just copied it and sprinkled some of our own ideas), it was not about doing a bunch of automation for the sake of it, it was about building things in a repeatable, stable and predictable way. DevOps was just a part of the buzzwording, the idea behind committing to availability, good and steady service levels and good monitoring was beyond a hype, it promised to fix what we would otherwise take forever to do properly. I knew the world before all these CI/CD, observability, availability (and so on...) concepts came along and it has been a net positive, yet I think we ended up caring too much about the tools rather than the problem they were solving, the aftermath is we hire for people knowing Kubernetes, Terraform and Jenkins and forget about load, elasticity, idempotence or repeatability. Yes, it is very convenient to grab, set and forget but if one thing is truth in the computer world is that one size **never** fits all.

Where am I going with this rant glued to a collection of terms? I think we forgot what SRE was meant to do and what skills SRE needed in the first place. As difficult as it may seem (even for me, I suck as a developer compared to many of my peers), we didn’t need glorified sysadmins moving out from VMware, getting hands on AWS just to stay in force, we just needed better developers. Good developers are not the guys who can nail every single leetcode problem, good developers understand the pros and cons from their language, the resource constraints they have to handle, the limits they have to set and the nature of the environment where their code will run. Containerization created a mist thick enough that it became very hard to differentiate between good developers and fast shipping code monkeys. SRE just came to take off the load of fixing broken environments where poor quality code was shipped. Then we had the worst of both worlds: Mediocre site engineers picking up the broken pieces of mediocre developers.

This starts to sound like I am sour. And to be fair: I am (frustrated, actually); I will make a parenthesis here to talk more about that SRE sunsetting initiative. I must give a big warning here, in case this is not evident, I am talking from my own limited perspective, I probably have gotten a bunch of facts and conditions wrong so take everything from this page with a grain of salt.

When some clever guys decided to get rid of SRE, they didn’t envision the rot this would cause across all of the engineering branch from our company. They just wanted to drop the garbage over the fence without a good plan on how things should look by the end of this plan. I think from the beginning the hiring was flawed. Including myself, the bar was not high enough that you could just replace an SDE with an SRE and viceversa, it was just not possible for a good amount of people working there, either because like me, they lacked skill working with a specific language or simply the expertise to make good software engineering decisions. In any case, we had a few hundreds of engineers doing the nasty work of dealing with incident management and configuration management. Had we hired the right profile, we would be solving hard problems with a good understanding of the strengths and flaws from our platform, not to say planning for scale which I dare to say, our SDE counterparts understood better.
Still this was something that had to be done and we executed. I want to say I did my best to transfer those incident management and configuration management skills to the SDE teams, I think this was not good enough though and I saw plenty of expected mistakes and incidents and not so expected burnouts and people getting canned. This took a big toll on the company's morale and in the end it made whatever team I was left with a less appealing place to work. At some point in this execution we noticed this was not an easy task and recognized that the time given vs. the time needed was mismatching greatly, yet as usual we had deadlines and all those unhappy with the result would jump ship and move on with their life. To this day, I still believe we could have done a better job from the beginning, but this would just be crying over spilled milk.


In a perfect world would SRE exist then? I think all the concepts that Google (which eventually backed off from their plans and just moved their teams to India before hiding their heads like turtles) have lined out in their books are the blueprint on how to do good site engineering. But the need for a dedicated role is just plain dumb. Just like you learn to analyze algorithms when you’re majoring in computer science, site reliability is part of any good software engineer formation, not a role you can pick like choosing between frontend and backend, even in this reference you cannot do a good job on one role without having a good understanding of the other. I think the idea of “you build it you run it” is paramount on what any professional should expect, probably this is scratching on a larger, most hairy topic which is the lack of accountability people in IT has compared to any other profession (you can screw up big time, you can cause big losses, yet you rarely see larger consequences other than losing a job).

Do I have anything left to say here? Well, word of advice: get rid of buzzwords, get rid of the next big thing, if you want to take away something from all this mess it is: build to scale, and building to scale **never** relies on a product. Get away from the contentment, the next great thing is always around the corner and you need curiosity to drive your organization, not doing by the book.

## Small bursts

This is a section I plan on dedicating to small bursts of comments. I often like to add my opinion and even illustrate using AI generated images (although they have been quite sloppy lately), while I enjoy doing that, it is time consuming and I want to be thoughtful about what I write, yet I need to drop some thoughts from time to time and probably here is the right place, so a section is born (?), I am still not interested in making this a github.io page the less moving to a content provider (and of course not getting a domain, that's pricey when done right).

### DevOps is not SRE, or is it? (05/24)

This is a silly shitpost, but I want to share it because it is often used as a synonym and great people end up hating their duties due to the huge confusion Google created with this term. So wanna know the difference? I think I can summarize it in a few lines: SRE means engineers **obsessed** about site up, performance, service levels and whatever it takes to get there. Fix code? Yes, Fix infra? Yes, Fix monitoring? Of course! Negotiate service levels? Maybe. Automation? Yes! DevOps on the other hand is handling the power to run a service to its developers, no more sysadmin doing your dirty work. So essentially, it looks like DevOps should be doing SRE, right? I tend to see it the other way around, SRE will do the DevOps part to keep the lights on. DevOps (although it should not) focuses on the tools to make the show run smoothly from inception to deployment. So in real life what does it mean? Want the best, most badass container maniacs that can do CI/CD? get yourself a DevOps guy. Want to get your service fine tuned and focus on building at scale? Get yourself an SRE.

### I think desperation is fuel... and not in a good way (05/24)

I try to steer away from discussing political issues when going online. There is no way to win and the outcome is never useful to create new ties. So I will only point out some traits that bring me to the thoughts that defined the title. During my lifetime I have been able to live in different countries; some were more tied to what we used to call the east and some that represent the west itself. I noticed that many of our systems, intentionally or not, are good enablers for people to make bad decisions that will result in desperation for them. Bad decisions paired with a poor education are catastrophic, despite this, it is easier to get in trouble than it is to get out of it, or better yet, not to get into it in the first place.
I bite my tongue to provide specific examples that can be interpreted as criticism of a specific nation (it has never been my intention), but I think these few I will provide will resonate to many. You have access to egregious types of debt that limit the ability to make good decisions for yourself. You are at a constant risk of losing wealth, health or both with no easy recovery in sight. You are often pushed to pursue a poor quality of life in exchange for limited opportunity. Why am I writing these lines anyway? I am just reflecting on how easy it is to build desperation rather than prosperity in our current frameworks and how frightening this is knowing there is not much commitment to do things differently as we mostly (and reasonably nonetheless) run in this wild rat race that we call life.

### A month has gone by (07/24)

Just like the title says, tomorrow marks the first month since I came back to my land. It has been super exhaustive. I had no idea on how many things we had to sort out, to fix, to get done and still we find everyday there's something else missing. Simply put, I've never been busier. I am happy to be back, I am happy to be busy and I hope for have yet more things to do in the near future because being busy is fuel for me. Along the things I had to sort out (including fixing many home owner shenanigans, I had the opportunity to put back to use my raspberry pi's cluster which has been didactic as usual; now I am in the search for projects that can put to good use the 80% CPU I have left for those few machines.

### What I miss from our life in America (07/24)

America is a difficult place. It is a country that is built to test you, the place where you can be the best version of yourself and the place where you can meet your worst fate. Yet I think America is unique and I miss a lot from it. I don't miss its savage health system or its weirdness regarding races and mindsets. I miss what freedom means there, I miss its people and I miss what its people made of it. I don't feel sorry or regret about leaving America, after all, my home is not there. I think America is a great example of what a country can be except it is hard to understand it unless you've been there for longer than a vacation. The love of the land, the make it work no matter what, the do it right and do it best mindsets are what I miss the hardest. I wish my country had some vague resemblance to those ideas, but hey, not everywhere is the same.

### Back from a break (07/24)

So I'm back from a break. I'd like to say rested, but lately rest has different meanings to me. I'm on a long break so you don't take breaks from a break. It was more of a disconnect from my new city, trying to get a new place (didn't work, no good offers), so at least my patience drain was somehow fixed while gone. Now, I'm up for searching to stop my break and do more stuff. Yes, I've been doing things here and there, but looking forward to having a more solid plan before the year ends. In the meantime, I do some code golfing and tiny projects because why not? Because I write this for myself here are some areas where I want to put some time:
* Go ✔️
* Flink ✔️
* Terraform ✔️
* Airflow ✔️
* Jenkins ✔️

### My two cents on "coding" interviews (07/24)

Yes I am one more of those guys. I see no benefit to them other than stress the shit out of a person to no good end. I would say I am the same as happy doing these interviews as I am creating 1 machine cluster using kubernetes. Two of the most enjoyable interview processes I had (and memorable since they really demanded more skills than memorizing algorithms or snooping over the answers tab) were with Klarna and Wizeline; Klarna asked me not only to provide complex functions but to actually write a service to query those functions and emit metrics for them (2 days given for the task) and Wizeline asked me to write a function in a language they invented so they could evaluate my ability to learn and work with what I learned (no guy on the other side of the terminal). I wish I could mention Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft of Meta here, but nope, they all do the same silly dance, so I dare to say that I don't see this inventive anywhere in big tech, I know, the process was created to pick the brightest but just as with immigration, it is gamed and not fun at all. So I am done with this nonsense, even if I had to give up my career, I will always push back on it. Not saying puzzles are crap, they are not, but using them as the first step to filter out the competence of a candidate based on algorithms and problems that they may not need it's more of a bluff than a real need.

### I'm a dork using node (08/24)

So I just can say, I am an idiot when it comes to working with NodeJS. I started using it recently and testing using Playwright and while I am happy about how much it sucks to know nothing about it, I am dumb using these. To the point I want to turn off my computer and go get mad with a rock for being a rock.

### The challenge of picking a topic... or more than one (08/24)

As I take my time to learn, I can brag my understanding of Golang has improved drastically, but just as I push myself to learn the language, I feel the urge to learn other technologies. Node, Playwright, Flink, Terraform, Helm and the list goes on; unfortunately the list can be as long as the day but my capacity is limited. Learning Go for the 5th time in my lifetime has been a challenge. Normally I would go through the basics, but never looked further and what it takes to make something other than a tutorial. I found a bunch of good resources and I am learning to write some metrics through a server but Go is more than a handy native HTTP server. So this is my way to vent the frustration it causes me to try to play catchup with all the things I'd like to get better at with a limited amount of time and attention span, because even if I manage to get 16 hours in the day to focus on learning, I don't think I can borrow from my brain its capacity beyond 4 hours. I know this can be solved through priorities and time, let's see how things change.

### The joy of getting something (08/24)

So just typing this as I can say things finally sunk in for a couple topics I was struggling to get right. Yes, I'm still a dumb noob in both but the feeling of acomplishment reminds me on when you get that lift after trying for weeks and out of thin air it just happens, except  it is not thin air, but persistance.

### Reflection time (08/24)

Sorry this is not about the reflection concept where code analyzes its own structure (amazingly I was doing this once upon a time for an API without even knowing this had a name). This post will have a few lines I write for my future self. I would post this at LinkedIn if my ego was bigger, but since I'm probably the only reader here, this is for me.

One of the things I had most trouble with when I moved to the valley was the "_eat what you kill_" approach. I was used to having someone else bringing me a problem and then trying to solve it. Trying to find what is wrong without someone pointing it out can be dangerous, especially when applied outside your work, then you become arrogant, otherwise it is a blessing, because starting a business idea is not much different.

Just the same comes when picking what you want for your future self (career wise). It is very easy to have someone else lay out a plan and go with it. But this deprives you both from introspective and the ability to own your failures. It is hard to define a list of things you don't want and it is important, but it is harder and probably more important to define a list of things that you want, because then the one responsible for choosing where you're taking your life and what to do when your plan fails becomes all yours.

Don't go easy on learning. It is hard enough to figure out what to learn. Sometimes learning is driven by demand, sometimes by need and sometimes by curiosity. In any case identify when something is not serving you and also identify when your learning is limited. Don't wait for a need to come from somewhere else for starting to learn something, your learning will be limited maybe but it won't be useless. When you learn, don't settle for a tutorial, find a project, create a need and satisfy it.

Move on. If things are not changing, if things are too comfortable, if things are too uncomfortable, move on. Let change happen.

Future me, this is the idiot you were once ago. I wish you well.

### K8s lab runs smoother in WSL2 (08/24)

Not much technicality here, all I came to write down is that creating a kubernetes lab cluster is way simpler using K3C than pushing it to K3S in different physical machines. I think the why here is simple, especially when working with raspberry machines: write speed is non-trivial in the subsystem and a disk is better suited than an SD (duh!). So This is me telling two stories, the first one on how I spend a few hours a day trying to get a better idea on kubernetes parts and where they break and the second is how can I just plug this into my existing hardware and roll. The second is how I came to find that the simplest way to manage a tiny four machine cluster (on-prem) is still Ansible and some patience. Yes, I lose the goodies from using containers, but in those tiny ass machines, the only thing I really care about is recovering my images when things go awry which is not often anyway. No rant here, I am just talking about my biased experience from the past couple of weeks.

### Flask redirects (08/24)

So I just realized it has been close to zero the times I have ever used redirects in flask... So I did something about it. And also took the time to do some rate limiting in requests (a shitty one because it doesn't set time windows or tracks requestor), but I was more interested in sharing context without sharing globals like the use of `g` which is hell when doing testing. Anyway, I am posting that in a gist since doing this here is kind of too much. I think I just got invested in the idea because I needed a break from the overload channels and parallelization that I've been struggling to master in Golang :hearts:

### Being thorough pays off (09/24)

I am likely the less appropriate person to talk about thoroughness but I think not being lazy when delivering a simple project is always a good thing. When you craft with a minimum standard disregard the purpose you will find that your work shines by itself. I wanted to come and rant about a service where I noticed my PII was being leaked through the request via the URL, but I will just assume that the person who built it had no time to put things together in a proper fashion or simply they lacked the education that would elevate their craftsmanship, whatever the reason is, being thorough (educating yourself on how to write REST properly, how to send data, how to cypher and encode data or simply reading OWASP reports) matters… a lot!
