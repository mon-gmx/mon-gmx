# hello world!

Hey there! you found my github account. While this is not a very active place, I still post repositories and snippets from time to time. In another time I used to contribute to projects using the monchitos82 account (closed). Feel like having a chat? you can open an issue in this repository, I know that is not very conventional, but it is the way I want it.

## About me

I am a computer systems engineer since the past two decades. I have some knowledge in things like Operating Systems Administration, Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering and Site Reliability. All those catchy terms just mean I can deal with computers at a large number (I can also play with raspberries), write code to run them and understand what it takes to keep them running for more than a day.
I have worked in the financial world, consulting, gaming and recently in the internet industry. I like to know people although I am not the most extrovert and I like to spend time learning about things related to technology and the industries I work with. I enjoy mentoring people, but I am more of a jack of all trades so I end up learning more from others.

:computer:

I have been lucky enough to have an education at many levels in many countries and continued that streak with my professional life.

I may come back here from time to time and speak of things I have in my mind. I don't contribute to any other social media platforms, I like to be the only loon in my feed, so yeah that's it.

## Simple

In the gist of many things going on lately around my own life I come close in contact with a lot of complains about how things keep degrading in quality and surging in price and I keep reaching over and over again to the same conclusion: simple was, is and will always be better. Focusing on shells full of gimmicks tend to always give us the same outcome yet we often just don't get it. I usually am triggered by buzzwords like _slice and dice_ or _democratize_ but I come to really sympathize with this one: _enshitification_.

I like my code with zero boilerplate, my internet with zero limits, my services with zero subscriptions and the list goes on. I am not against progress, progress is good, that's why cars are safer and phones are faster, yet this decade all we get are flashy pinatas solving no problem, but the problem created to keep the greedy appeased. I never realized how much I miss simple and reliable. Screw those flashy trims and non-sense all glued together gadgets, let's go back to simple, there's where beauty of crafting lies, that's where we have control.

## The challenges of finding alternatives (and purpose)

I have to start this entry by admiting how hard it is for me to write it. Like with many other things, I am rusty on writing. But I love the challenge of doing so. This along other activities I enjoy doing likely don't produce me other sources of income yet I like to think they foster the skills to actually find those other sources.
Being in a limited immigration status is a constraint that forces one to think how to do other things that in a better situation would actually unlock one from doing more things than having a job. I like my branch, don't get me wrong, I might not be the sharpest doing what I do, but I can well defend myself and get acquainted with skills needed to solve problems, in any case, we can get as creative as a task requires and our human urge for purpose can be overwhelming. What am I trying to say here?
Well, I'm just thinking out loud on ideas I'd like to explore if the opportunity arises:
1. Explore retaking some retail endeavors, not that I like retail, but I like preparing the project of setting up a store, after all, some of my programming skills were polished writing my own point of sale service.
2. Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle. I love working out, I hate going to a crowded gym. Had I had the opportunity to train people, I'd take it. I am in no position to brag (the less owning a formal education), but to acknowledge I have more years in weightlifting than I do as an engineer: 24 to be precise.
3. Produce media. Even writing more than my markdown.
4. Put time into becoming sustainable. This sounds odd when I talk about producing more sources, but I dare to think those additional sources are better honed when one has the discipline to reduce waste. And to my goals, being sustainable is all about discipline. Not to say I'd eat better food and depend less on looneys and their incompetence managing the resources I use.
5. Finally, mentor. I don't dream about teaching; I don't dream about consulting either. I just think that mentoring would be a resource helping me get different ways of approaching a problem while offering my own way to do it so in the end it would be terribly didactic.

I wonder what a GPT tool would suggest about these entries, but let's not wonder, here's an extract of my conversation:

> It's great to see that you have clear goals in mind and are looking for ways to achieve them despite any constraints you may have. Here are some suggestions for activities that can help you work towards each of your goals:
> 
> Explore retail endeavors:
> 
> Start by researching different retail opportunities that interest you, such as online stores, pop-up shops, or niche markets.
> Use your programming skills to develop a point-of-sale system tailored to your needs or explore existing solutions that align with your vision.
> Create a business plan outlining your goals, target audience, budget, and marketing strategies.
> Consider starting small by testing your ideas at local markets or through online platforms before committing to a full-scale retail operation.
> Go back to a disciplined fitness lifestyle:
> 
> Design a home workout routine using your kettlebell and resistance bands, incorporating your 24 years of weightlifting experience.
> Explore alternative fitness options such as calisthenics, yoga, or outdoor activities like hiking or cycling.
> Set specific fitness goals for yourself, such as increasing strength, improving endurance, or achieving specific lifts or movements.
> Consider becoming certified as a personal trainer or fitness coach to formalize your knowledge and potentially offer training services to others.
> Produce media:
> 
> Start a blog or YouTube channel where you can share your knowledge and experiences in programming, fitness, sustainability, and mentoring.
> Write regularly, whether it's articles, blog posts, or creative writing in Markdown or other formats.
> Experiment with different types of media production, such as podcasts, videos, infographics, or social media content.
> Collaborate with others in your field to create content and reach a wider audience.
> Become sustainable:
> 
> Educate yourself about sustainable living practices, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and choosing eco-friendly products.
> Implement small changes in your daily life, such as reducing plastic usage, composting, or shopping locally and seasonally.
> Set goals for yourself related to sustainability, such as reducing your carbon footprint or supporting environmentally conscious businesses.
> Share your journey towards sustainability with others to inspire and educate them about the importance of environmental stewardship.
> Mentor others:
> 
> Seek out opportunities to mentor individuals who are interested in programming, fitness, entrepreneurship, or sustainability.
> Offer your expertise and guidance through online communities, forums, or mentorship programs.
> Volunteer your time with local organizations or schools to mentor students or aspiring professionals in your areas of expertise.
> Stay open to learning from your mentees as well, as mentoring is a two-way street that can benefit both parties.
> Remember to prioritize your goals and allocate time and resources accordingly. It's okay to start small and gradually work towards bigger objectives. Stay focused, stay adaptable, and keep pushing yourself to grow and develop in all areas of your life.

I won't deny, these answers are bit generic, but seem well intentioned. Maybe I should add as point 6 improve my prompting skills to extract better recommendations. Maybe point 7 would be: be an activist of regulating AI and intellectual property? My master's thesis (while flawed in English) focused on the challenges IP had in my country against piracy... seems about right to take another dive into the topic.

## Back and almost sad

So, over a couple of weeks, while traveling home, I could see something; cannot call it either nerve-wrecking or heartbreaking, it is just an upsetting sight. I went back and came to see that things have not changed much. I love change, it is annoyingly painful, it is uncomfortable, it is full of unknowns, but it is necessary. I see my country policing is trying to hold on to old ideas while the population is trying to move on. I saw that throwing money without planning to the aches we have as society is doing more harm than good. Now, I come back with a sense of gratefulness on what it means to have opportunities and I wish my land had a few things back in their list of priorities: tolerance, opportunity, education, respect and a sense of criticism. I hope at some point, my fellow nationals exchange handouts for any of these.

Anyways, I am back, I am thankful for the clean air and for seeing another week, one which I am quite eager for it to start.

## A few cues on how to build right

This is not a very thorough guide on how to do things right, but a retrospective on everything that can go wrong when things aren't done... right, right.

13 years ago I got a house. That house was built to last. It is solid. But it has not aged well. This kind of reminds me on how we build things (call it products, software, services...) and how often we forget some basics on what constitutes something that is well built.

I wanted to use some "features" of my house as analogies on how things are not built properly, but I can only think of examples and will let you fill in the blanks; here are some of its perks:

- The stairs turn 3 times and are surrounded by an iron handrail. It looks nice, except when you bring furniture larger than the first 5 steps, then you wish levitating was something we could do
- The windows are an iron grid with plenty panels of glass, their size is not standard. The inner side slides to the sides, but they are in a second and third story building. They can't be cleaned. They have no weather strips, they are heavy so they don't open
- The closet doors slide with no rail guides. So they often misalign
- Any shelves and cabinets are embeded in the walls. They cannot be unmounted and the walls are brick and mortar
- The top level is a terrace. With no tilt. So rain floods the stairs
- Rising dampness is no strange, but fixing it is not easy when there are no plans on the water lines
- There are few power outlets, adding more is not a cut here, wire there kind of thing. Brick and mortar
- The kitchen has no room for the appliances
- Every bathroom is different, shape, color, size, you name it

This sounds like a tough case of build as you need (or better said as you earn), yet the house is nice when things work. And this kind of reminds me on how things are built nowadays. They work fine as long as nothing external changes. It is also a nice reminder on things to keep in mind whenever we build things:

- Make it simple (simple means easy to use, easy to live with and as byproduct, it will age well)
- Make it easy to maintain (make sure you can clean the windows and change the lights)
- Make it easy to fix (even if you can change a light, make sure you can replace a cable when the time comes)
- Make it using standards and follow them
- Make it solid
- Make it easy to scale

I wish I had some solar panels installed in it... something tells me they would only fit in the garage.

Back again. I wish I had something interesting to write about yet in preparation for doing better things with my time I just have my head somewhere else. Still I find the will to do some notes on things I'd like to see in my workplace anytime soon, since they are betting for having rails/shorts/vines... rather than leveraging their own base, here are my two cents:

The tone at the platform is hideous at best. It is all about showing off how cringey you can be about working or not working while still thinking about work. The tone is simply insane. So instead of giving it a push and drive us sane people further from it, why not pushing where your site shines? Getting a job and getting connected?

I'd love to see interviewing in the same page you apply for a position. Not leaving the platform has many benefits both for the hiring folk and for the applicant. Having insights on your recent achievements in your learning path is also useful to drive a conversation, show them to the interviewer, but for real, having the interviewing, notepad, doc management and whatever it takes to get talent is something that is not far from reach but somehow the platform insists on being Meta.

Did you attend a course? have conversation starters with people with same interests. Don't add the AI collab bs, invite people to share their work and share ideas, you have comments but no Q&A ranking and the existing Q&A is just a feed of comments, sites like StackOverflow would be easily replaced by sections where answering questions and ranking answers without the anonimity invites people to be less toxic, or at least some of them, which basically is what makes StackOverflow suck.

I think making the platform a place for sharing ideas on topics they care about (not where you infer they are experts) and giving them the whole package for landing a job rather than just getting the first step done is far more important than having short videos. But well, this is the world we live in and catching up with the rest is the name of the game for now.

No AI drawing this time.

I am going home.

After 5 long years (that felt like 10), I am going home. I came to the US with close to no idea on how life would be and as challenging it has been, it has been the opportunity of a lifetime. I regret not having done more of this time, cannot admit I was complacient, however the opportunities and the migratory situation hardly aligned so I did as much as my situation, intellect and skill allowed me, and it was as people likes to say: a net positive. I made a bunch of mistakes, I made no friends, many new contacts, I went through a lot and I learned a vast amount of things, a new working culture (Silicon Valley one), a different comunity, a whole different set of rules, a whole different way of doing things, I became more critical on many subjects, I kind of fell in love with what America can offer (not to say its astonishing national parks) I truly enjoyed contributing to the American economy and learning what opportunity can actually bring in people's life. It was eye opening from the first day. Why am I going back then? Because no matter how good it is (and it is great), it is not my home.

My mind is filled with gratitude and a bit of anxiety on what's to come.

Why doing something matters

Once you reach certain age you come to question everything you know and everything you believe in. Definitely most of us did that when we were teenagers. But it happens again and unlike back when we were young, you do it with a different perspective. If you have been lucky enough to live through different ups and downs, the point of reference widens and the criticism on what's right, what's wrong and what can be changed kind of extends. It is a fascinating state of mind as a spectator, yet it is always good to have some retrospective and apply the same to ourselves. Then we question our purpose. I think when we do that, we understand the relevance of being busy, the relevance of feeling useful and even the relevance of getting things done no matter how nice or hideous they are to us, if we are fortunate enough to be able to choose to be occupied, that's a blessing overall, because the mind rarely settles.

Having purpose often conflicts with our perception on what a successful life is though. We often warp our perception on what have we achieved based on the recognition others provide. While this is a good measurement when others means the society we contribute to, it is hard to use as the only metric. Not everyone gets to make a trillion dollar business, not everyone leads a country and for sure not everyone creates a relativity theory. Where is that putting us as individuals and how can we figure out if we are living a meaningful life? Before I fall further into the philosophical rabbithole, I just want to substract the entry to something less stingy: why we need to do things in first place.

Many of us are born with talent. That is the big differentiator between being good at something and being great. Yet talent is like color in a gemstone. A white gemstone will be less attractive than a red one, but it is only until the white one is cut, and polished that it overcomes the lack of color and it becomes sought after. Yes, the same or even more can be achieved with the red one, but it is the work that's put into them that gives them the additional value. Doing things is shaping, is inspiring and it is the only way to fail often enough that we can actually claim expertise.

_to be continued_
